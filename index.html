  <p style="font-family:courier;">Made By: Group 8</p>

<h1 style="text-align:center; color:#000000; font-family:timesnewroman; font-size:34px;">About Our Second Stream</h1>


    <p style="text-align:center; color:#000000; font-family:timesnewroman; font-size:24px;">Our Second Stream was entitled "How students may make positive use of Facebook." basically it was all about informing others especially students about the benefits  of Facebook.</p>

 
   <h2 style="text-align:left; color:#00008B; font-family:geaorgia; font-size:34px;">The Things well done during our stream.</h2>

<li>AUDIO - Though, we had a slight problem at the beginning as the one mic wasn’t that audible, we were still able to fix it by improvising and just using the other mic that we had.</li>
<br>
<li>CAMERA  - We positioned our camera in a well good place where the whole members would fit in the frame. so, Allthroughout the stream we didn’t have any problems with the camera as everyone was  clearly seen the whole time.
</li>
<br>
<li>TRANSITIONS - We were able to test and conduct a dry run with our equipment to ensure optimal functionality. </li>
<br>
<li>FOLLOWED THE STREAM OUTLINE - We practiced and prepared our flow earlier, so we were able to follow our stream outline.</li>
<br>
<br>
<p>Everything with the equipment we have operated well. Compared to our previous stream, we had a better camera quality that worked much better, and our microphone worked well and was more audible. </p>
<p>We fully explained our topic, provided the audience with new information for them to learn something new, and further enhanced their understanding of the topics we covered, based on their comments and feedback stating that they understood our topic well. Besides that, we managed to follow according to our stream outline. In contrast to our previous stream, where we spoke about our topic too quickly, and based on our latest stream we discussed and expressed our opinions about it more slowly and appropriately.
</p>

 
  
   <h1 style="text-align:left; color:#00008B; font-family:geaorgia; font-size:34px;">Areas of Oppurtunities of our Stream</h1>

<li>MODERATING CHAT</li>
<li>FLOW OF THE PRSENTATION</li>
<li>MICROPHONE</li>
<p>We believe that we couldn’t properly control our presentation flow as it was not us controlling it, we also didn’t want to tell him to change slides everytime because it would look more like a presentation and not a stream. He also couldn’t moderate chat as he was too focused on our slides and watching our stream on his phone for any problems. One of our mics was very quiet and we only noticed after already using it for over half the stream when viewers pointed it out.
</p>


<h2 style="text-align:left; color:#00008B; font-family:geaorgia; font-size:34px;">Level of Engagement During Our Stream.</h2>
<li>HIGH ENGAGEMENT</li>
<p>The engagement between the streamers and viewers/chatters was very high especially throughout the icebreaker section where we asked them to participate in the game but even after the games they were always active and asking questions or just sharing their opinion.</p>
  
   <h1 style="text-align:left; color:#00008B; font-family:geaorgia; font-size:34px;">How the Level of Engagement Affect the Overall Performance of our Stream
</h1>
<p>We believe that because of the high level of engagement, our stream was more entertaining and interesting. Interacting with our viewers was also helpful in making the stream longer.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left; color:#00008B; font-family:geaorgia; font-size:34px;">Level of Viewership.</h2>
<li>HIGH VIEWERSHIP</li>
<p>Unlike our first stream, we had a high level of viewership this time around and that could be explained by our promotional strategies being different. We used reels to promote our stream, we also posted it on each of our personal Instagram accounts. We also had more interesting things lined up for our viewers in our stream which we shared in our reel. The main thing that attracted attention to our stream was the icebreaker which had 200 pesos for the winner, but overall our stream was much more entertaining and interesting than last time.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#000000; font-family:geaorgia; font-size:34px;">Stream Analytics:</h2>

<center>
<img src="Analytics.PNG"style="width:800px;height:400px;">
</center>


<li>AVERAGE VIEWERS</li>
<p>In the figure it shows that we had 14 average viewers which was 12 more than our last stream which was only a dry run, this also means that all throughout our stream we were averaging 14 viewers.</p>
<br>
<li>MAX VIEWERS</li>
<p>In the figure above it states that we had a Max Viewer count of 21, what this means is that during our live stream our viewer count reached 21 viewers which was the highest we achieved.</p>
<li>UNIQUE VIEWERS</li>
<p>We had an influx of Unique Viewers totaling to 39, this means that there were 39 new users tuning into our stream for the very first time.</p>
<li>UNIQUE CHATTERS</li>
<p>Like Unique Viewers, these are new users chatting on our stream for the first time and there were 11 which is 11 more than our last stream.</p>
<li>LIVE VIEWS</li>
<p>Live views are the collective amount of viewers a stream has in total. Our stream had a total of 75 live views which is 70 more than our previous stream but it was only a dry run so it does not matter a whole lot.</p>
<li>FOLLOWERS</li>
<p>Though in the first figure it said that we did not gain followers, in this second figure we had actually gained 3. This is further proven by checking our stream page which says that we have 7 followers when it was only 4 before streaming.
